# Ultimate-Agent

Ultimate-Agent is a complete AI agent orchestration framework that combines real LLM integration, advanced planning, real-time monitoring, and extensible tooling. It ships with a production-ready backend core and a React-based dashboard for monitoring execution in real time.

## Key Features

- **Claude API Integration** – Async Claude client for code synthesis, validation, documentation, and test generation with retry logic and token accounting.
- **Advanced Planning Strategies** – Four DAG-based planning strategies (simple, parallel optimized, resource aware, cost optimized) to balance speed, budget, and robustness.
- **Rich Tooling** – File I/O helpers, data processing utilities, and a central tool registry that enables simple integration of new capabilities.
- **Execution Orchestration** – DAG scheduler, policy guardrails, checkpointing, and SQLite-backed memory for resilient, auditable task runs.
- **Monitoring Dashboard** – React dashboard featuring execution control, live task visualization, metrics, and run history.

## Repository Structure

```
.
├── README.md
├── complete_agent_system.py    # Backend orchestration engine
└── dashboard/                  # React dashboard source (see instructions below)
```

> **Note:** The dashboard directory contains the React code referenced in the overview. If it is missing, run the agent bootstrap script to regenerate the assets or consult the documentation generated by the agent workflow.

## Getting Started

1. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
2. **Set Anthropic Credentials**
   ```bash
   export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="your_api_key"
   ```
3. **Run the Agent Demo**
   ```bash
   python complete_agent_system.py
   ```

The demo exercises the parallel-optimized planning strategy, executes tasks against the registered tools, and produces artifacts under `./output` while logging telemetry into `agent_memory.db`.

## Development Tips

- Planning strategies and tool registrations live in `complete_agent_system.py`. Extend the planner or add tools to tailor the orchestration to new workflows.
- The SQLite memory (`agent_memory.db`) stores structured event logs that can be inspected for analytics or debugging.
- Checkpoints are written to `./checkpoints` so executions can resume after interruptions.
